# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game (UI)- Odin Project Solution
This repository contains my solution to The Odin Project's Rock, Paper, Scissors game project. In this project, I have designed and implemented a fully functional Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to make their choices and displays the winner based on the traditional rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

# How to Play
Open the index.html file in your web browser to start the game.
Select your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) by clicking on the respective icon.
The computer (AI) will make its selection.
The game will display the round result, indicating whether you won, lost, or tied.
Continue playing until you decide to stop.

# Technologies Used
HTML: For creating the structure of the game.
CSS: For styling and layout.
JavaScript: For implementing the game logic and interactivity.
