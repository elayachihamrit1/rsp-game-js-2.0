# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game (UI)- Odin Project Solution
This repository contains my solution to The Odin Project's Rock, Paper, Scissors game project. In this project, I have designed and implemented a fully functional Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to make their choices and displays the winner based on the traditional rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

# Technologies Used
HTML: For creating the structure of the game.
CSS: For styling and layout.
JavaScript: For implementing the game logic and interactivity.
